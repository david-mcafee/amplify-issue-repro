Is the issue that `create-expo-app` uses Expo Go?
- attempting @1.3.4
- attempting https://docs.amplify.aws/gen2/start/manual-installation/

THE FOLLOWING ALWAYS FAILS (and is in our docs):

- npx expo run:ios?

My build issues were related to this:

- https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/15809
- related to something in bash profile
